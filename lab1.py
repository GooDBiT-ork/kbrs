main_text = r"""techno is a genre of electronic dance music which is generally produced for use in a continuous dj set with tempo often varying between and beats per minute bpm the central rhythm is typically in common time and often characterized by a repetitive four on the floor beat artists may use electronic instruments such as drum machines sequencers and synthesizers as well as digital audio workstations drum machines from the s such as rolands tr and tr are highly prized and software emulations of such retro instruments are popular much of the instrumentation in techno emphasizes the role of rhythm over other musical parameters techno tracks mainly progress over manipulation of timbral characteristics of synthesizer presets and unlike forms of edm that tend to be produced with synthesizer keyboards techno does not always strictly adhere to the harmonic practice of western music and such structures are often ignored in favor of timbral manipulation alone another distinguishing feature of techno music and techno aesthetic is the general embracement of creative use of music production technology use of the term techno to refer to a type of electronic music originated in germany in the early s in following the uk release of the compilation techno the new dance sound of detroit the term came to be associated with a form of edm produced in detroit detroit techno resulted from the melding of synthpop by artists such as kraftwerk giorgio moroder and yellow magic orchestra with african american styles such as house electro and funk added to this is the influence of futuristic and sciencefiction themes relevant to life in american late capitalist society with alvin tofflers book the third wave a notable point of reference the music produced in the midtolate s by juan atkins derrick may and kevin saunderson collectively known as the belleville three along with eddie fowlkes blake baxter james pennington and others is viewed as the first wave of techno from detroit after the success of house music in a number of european countries techno grew in popularity in the uk germany belgium and the netherlands in europe regional variants quickly evolved and by the early s techno subgenres such as acid hardcore bleep ambient and dub techno had developed music journalists and fans of techno are generally selective in their use of the term so a clear distinction can be made between sometimes related but often qualitatively different styles such as tech house and trance detroit techno main article detroit techno see also electro music house music italo disco kraftwerk and synthpop in exploring detroit technos origins writer kodwo eshun maintains that kraftwerk are to techno what muddy waters is to the rolling stones the authentic the origin the real juan atkins has acknowledged that he had an early enthusiasm for kraftwerk and giorgio moroder particularly moroders work with donna summer and the producers own album emc atkins also mentions that around i had a tape of nothing but kraftwerk telex devo giorgio moroder and gary numan and id ride around in my car playing it regarding his initial impression of kraftwerk atkins notes that they were clean and precise relative to the weird ufo sounds featured in his seemingly psychedelic music derrick may identified the influence of kraftwerk and other european synthesizer music in commenting that it was just classy and clean and to us it was beautiful like outer space living around detroit there was so little beauty everything is an ugly mess in detroit and so we were attracted to this music it like ignited our imagination may has commented that he considered his music a direct continuation of the european synthesizer tradition he also identified japanese synthpop act yellow magic orchestra particularly member ryuichi sakamoto and british band ultravox as influences along with kraftwerk ymos song technopolis a tribute to tokyo as an electronic mecca is considered an interesting contribution to the development of detroit techno foreshadowing concepts that atkins and davis would later explore with cybotron kevin saunderson has also acknowledged the influence of europe but he claims to have been more inspired by the idea of making music with electronic equipment i was more infatuated with the idea that i can do this all myself these early detroit techno artists additionally employed science fiction imagery to articulate their visions of a transformed society school days prior to achieving notoriety atkins saunderson may and fowlkes shared common interests as budding musicians mix tape traders and aspiring djs they also found musical inspiration via the midnight funk association an eclectic fivehour latenight radio program hosted on various detroit radio stations including wchb wgpr and wjlbfm from through the mids by dj charles the electrifying mojo johnson mojos show featured electronic music by artists such as giorgio moroder kraftwerk yellow magic orchestra and tangerine dream alongside the funk sounds of acts such as parliament funkadelic and dance oriented new wave music by bands like devo and the bs atkins has noted he mojo played all the parliament and funkadelic that anybody ever wanted to hear those two groups were really big in detroit at the time in fact they were one of the main reasons why disco didnt really grab hold in detroit in mojo used to play a lot of funk just to be different from all the other stations that had gone over to disco when knee deep came out that just put the last nail in the coffin of disco music despite the shortlived disco boom in detroit it had the effect of inspiring many individuals to take up mixing juan atkins among them subsequently atkins taught may how to mix records and in magic juan derrick mayday in conjunction with three other djs one of whom was eddie flashin fowlkes launched themselves as a party crew called deep space soundworks also referred to as deep space in or they met with mojo and proposed that they provide mixes for his show which they did end up doing the following year during the late searly s high school clubs such as brats charivari ciabattino comrades gables hardwear rafael rumours snobs and weekends allowed the young promoters to develop and nurture a local dance music scene as the local scene grew in popularity djs began to band together to market their mixing skills and sound systems to clubs that were hoping to attract larger audiences local church activity centers vacant warehouses offices and ymca auditoriums were the early locations where the musical form was nurtured juan atkins main articles juan atkins and cybotron american band of the four individuals responsible for establishing techno as a genre in its own right juan atkins is widely cited as the originator in the american music technology publication keyboard magazine honored him as one of who count in the history of keyboard music
in the early s atkins began recording with musical partner richard davis and later with a third member jon as cybotron this trio released a number of rock and electroinspired tunes the most successful of which were clear and its moodier followup techno city 
atkins used the term techno to describe cybotrons music taking inspiration from futurist author alvin toffler the original source for words such as cybotron and metroplex atkins has described earlier synthesizer based acts like kraftwerk as techno although many would consider both kraftwerks and juans cybotron outputs as electro atkins viewed cybotrons cosmic cars as unique germanic synthesized funk but he later heard afrika bambaataas planet rock and considered it to be a superior example of the music he envisioned inspired he resolved to continue experimenting and he encouraged saunderson and may to do likewise
eventually atkins started producing his own music under the pseudonym model and in he established the record label metroplex the same year saw an important turning point for the detroit scene with the release of model s no ufos a seminal work that is generally considered the first techno production of this time atkins has said
when i started metroplex around february or march of and released no ufos i thought i was just going to make my money back on it but i wound up selling between and copies i had no idea that my record would happen in chicago derricks parents had moved there and he was making regular trips between detroit and chicago so when i came out with no ufos he took copies out to chicago and gave them to some djs and it just happened
chicago see also chicago house and house music
the musics producers especially may and saunderson admit to having been fascinated by the chicago club scene and influenced by house in particular mays hit strings of life released under the alias rhythim is rhythim is considered a classic in both the house and techno genres
juan atkins also believes that the first acid house producers seeking to distance house music from disco emulated the techno sound atkins also suggests that the chicago house sound developed as a result of frankie knuckles using a drum machine he bought from derrick may he claims
derrick sold chicago dj frankie knuckles a tr drum machine this was back when the powerplant was open in chicago but before any of the chicago djs were making records they were all into playing italian imports no ufos was the only usbased independent record that they played so frankie knuckles started using the at his shows at the powerplant boss had just brought out their little sampling footpedal and somebody took one along there somebody was on the mic and they sampled that and played it over the drumtrack pattern having got the drum machine and the sampler they could make their own tunes to play at parties one thing just led to another and chip e used the to make his own record and from then on all these djs in chicago borrowed that to come out with their own records
in the uk a club following for house music grew steadily from with interest sustained by scenes in london manchester nottingham and later sheffield and leeds the djs thought to be responsible for houses early uk success include mike pickering mark moore colin faver and graeme park
detroit sound
the early producers enabled by the increasing affordability of sequencers and synthesizers merged a european synthpop aesthetic with aspects of soul funk disco and electro pushing edm into uncharted terrain they deliberately rejected the motown legacy and traditional formulas of rb and soul and instead embraced technological experimentation
within the last years or so the detroit underground has been experimenting with technology stretching it rather than simply using it as the price of sequencers and synthesizers has dropped so the experimentation has become more intense basically were tired of hearing about being in love or falling out tired of the rb system so a new progressive sound has emerged we call it techno
juan atkins 
the resulting detroit sound was interpreted by derrick may and one journalist in as a postsoul sound with no debt to motown but by another journalist a decade later as soulful grooves melding the beatcentric styles of motown with the music technology of the time may described the sound of techno as something that is like detroita complete mistake its like george clinton and kraftwerk are stuck in an elevator with only a sequencer to keep them company juan atkins has stated that it is music that sounds like technology and not technology that sounds like music meaning that most of the music you listen to is made with technology whether you know it or not but with techno music you know it
one of the first detroit productions to receive wider attention was derrick mays strings of life which together with mays previous release nude photo helped raise technos profile in europe especially the uk and germany during the house music boom see second summer of love it became mays best known track which according to frankie knuckles just exploded it was like something you cant imagine the kind of power and energy people got off that record when it was first heard mike dunn says he has no idea how people can accept a record that doesnt have a bassline
acid house
see also acid house rave and second summer of love
by house music had exploded in the uk and acid house was increasingly popular there was also a longestablished warehouse party subculture based around the sound system scene in the music played at warehouse parties was predominantly house that same year the balearic party vibe associated with ibizabased dj alfredo fiorito was transported to london when danny rampling and paul oakenfold opened the clubs shoom and spectrum respectively both night spots quickly became synonymous with acid house and it was during this period that the use of mdma as a party drug started to gain prominence other important uk clubs at this time included back to basics in leeds sheffields leadmill and music factory and in manchester the haçienda where mike pickering and graeme parks friday night spot nude was an important proving ground for american underground dance music acid house party fever escalated in london and manchester and it quickly became a cultural phenomenon mdmafueled club goers faced with am closing hours sought refuge in the warehouse party scene that ran all night to escape the attention of the press and the authorities this afterhours activity quickly went underground within a year however up to people at a time were attending the first commercially organized mass parties called raves and a media storm ensued
the success of house and acid house paved the way for wider acceptance of the detroit sound and vice versa techno was initially supported by a handful of house music clubs in chicago new york and northern england with london clubs catching up later but in it was strings of life which eased london clubgoers into acceptance of house according to dj mark moore
the new dance sound of detroit
main article techno the new dance sound of detroit
the mid uk release of techno the new dance sound of detroit an album compiled by exnorthern soul dj and kool kat records boss neil rushton at the time an ar scout for virgins records imprint and derrick may introduced of the word techno to uk audiences although the compilation put techno into the lexicon of music journalism in the uk the music was initially viewed as detroits interpretation of chicago house rather than as a separate genre the compilations working title had been the house sound of detroit until the addition of atkins song techno music prompted reconsideration rushton was later quoted as saying he atkins may and saunderson came up with the compilations final name together and that the belleville three voted down calling the music some kind of regional brand of house they instead favored a term they were already using techno
derrick may views this as one of his busiest times and recalls that it was a period where he
was working with carl craig helping kevin helping juan trying to put neil rushton in the right position to meet everybody trying to get blake baxter endorsed so that everyone liked him trying to convince shake anthony shakir that he should be more assertiveand keep making music as well as do the mayday mix for the show street beat on detroits wjlb radio station and run transmat records
commercially the release did not fare as well and failed to recoup but inner citys production big fun a track that was almost not included on the compilation became a crossover hit in fall the record was also responsible for bringing industry attention to may atkins and saunderson which led to discussions with ztt records about forming a techno supergroup called intellex but when the group were on the verge of finalising their contract may allegedly refused to agree to top of the pops appearances and negotiations collapsed according to may ztt label boss trevor horn had envisaged that the trio would be marketed as a black petshop boys
despite virgin records disappointment with the poor sales of rushtons compilation the record was successful in establishing an identity for techno and was instrumental in creating a platform in europe for both the music and its producers ultimately the release served to distinguish the detroit sound from chicago house and other forms of underground dance music that were emerging during the rave era of the late s and early s a period during which techno became more adventurous and distinct
music institute
in mid developments in the detroit scene led to the opening of a nightclub called the music institute mi located at broadway in downtown detroit the venue was secured by george baker and alton miller with darryl wynn and derrick may participating as friday night djs and baker and chez damier playing to a mostly gay crowd on saturday nights
the club closed on november with derrick may playing strings of life along with a recording of clock tower bells may explains
it all happened at the right time by mistake and it didnt last because it wasnt supposed to last our careers took off right around the time we the mi had to close and maybe it was the best thing i think we were peaking we were so full of energy and we didnt know who we were or how to realize our potential we had no inhibitions no standards we just did it thats why it came off so fresh and innovative and thats whywe got the best of the best
though shortlived mi was known internationally for its allnight sets its sparse white rooms and its juice bar stocked with smart drinks the institute never served liquor the mi notes dan sicko along with detroits early techno pioneers helped give life to one of the citys important musical subcultures one that was slowly growing into an international scene

in while working at frankfurts city music record store dj talla xlc started to use the term techno to categorize artists such as new order depeche mode kraftwerk heaven and front with the word used as shorthand for technologically created dance music tallas categorization became a point of reference for other djs including sven väth talla further popularized the term in germany when he founded technoclub at frankfurts no name club in which later moved to the dorian gray club in tallas club spot served as the hub for the regional ebm and electronic music scene and according to jürgen laarmann of frontpage magazine it had historical merit in being the first club in germany to play almost exclusively edm
frankfurt tape scene
inspired by tallas music selection in the early s several young artists from frankfurt started to experiment on cassette tapes with electronic music coming from the city music record store mixing the latest catalogue with additional electronic sounds and pitched bpm this became known as the frankfurt tape scene
the frankfurt tape scene evolved around the early and experimental work done by the likes of tobias freund uwe schmidt lars müller and martin schopf some of the work done by andreas tomalla markus nikolai and thomas franzmann evolved in collaborative work under the bigod collective while this early work was strongly characterized as experimental electronic music fused with strong ebm krautrock synthpop and technopop influences the later work during the mid and late s clearly transitioned to a clear techno sound
influence of chicago and detroit
germanys engagement with american underground dance music during the s paralleled that in the uk by a german party scene based around the chicago sound was well established the following year saw acid house making as significant an impact on popular consciousness in germany as it had in england in german djs westbam and dr motte established the ufo club an illegal party venue and cofounded the love parade following german reunification and the fall of the berlin wall on november free underground techno parties mushroomed in east berlin and a rave scene comparable to that in the uk was established east german dj paul van dyk has remarked that techno was a major force in reestablishing social connections between east and west germany during the unification period
growth of german scene
in a number of party venues in berlin closed including ufo and the citys techno scene centered itself around three locations close to the foundations of the berlin wall planet ewerk bunker and the longlived tresor it was in tresor at this time that a trend in paramilitary clothing was established amongst the techno fraternity by dj tanith possibly as an expression of a commitment to the underground aesthetic of the music or perhaps influenced by urs paramilitary posturing in the same period german djs began intensifying the speed and abrasiveness of the sound as an acid infused techno began transmuting into hardcore dj tanith commented at the time that berlin was always hardcore hardcore hippie hardcore punk and now we have a very hardcore house sound this emerging sound is thought to have been influenced by dutch gabber and belgian hardcore styles that were in their own perverse way paying homage to underground resistance and richie hawtins plus records other influences on the development of this style were european electronic body music ebm groups of the mids such as daf front and nitzer ebb
changes were also taking place in frankfurt during the same period but it did not share the egalitarian approach found in the berlin party scene it was instead very much centered around discothèques and existing arrangements with various club owners in after the omen opened the frankfurt dance music scene was allegedly dominated by the clubs management and they made it difficult for other promoters to get a start by the early s sven väth had become perhaps the first dj in germany to be worshipped like a rock star he performed center stage with his fans facing him and as coowner of omen he is believed to have been the first techno dj to run his own club one of the few real alternatives then was the bruckenkopf in mainz underneath a rhine bridge a venue that offered a noncommercial alternative to frankfurts discothèquebased clubs other notable underground parties were those run by force inc music works and ata heiko from playhouse records ongaku musik by dj dag torsten fenslau were running a sunday morning session at dorian gray a plush discothèque near the frankfurt airport they initially played a mix of different styles including belgian new beat deep house chicago house and synthpop such as kraftwerk and yello and it was out of this blend of styles that the frankfurt trance scene is believed to have emerged
in rave became a mainstream music phenomenon in germany seeing with it a return to melody new age elements insistently kitsch harmonies and timbres this undermining of the german underground sound lead to the consolidation of a german rave establishment spearheaded by the party organisation mayday with its record label low spirit dj westbam marusha and a music channel called viva at this time the german popular music charts were riddled with low spirit poptekno german folk music reinterpretations of tunes such as somewhere over the rainbow and tears dont lie many of which became hits at the same time in frankfurt a supposed alternative was a music characterized by simon reynolds as moribund middlebrow electrotrance music as represented by frankfurts own sven väth and his harthouse label
tekkno versus techno
in germany fans started to refer to the harder techno sound emerging in the early s as tekkno or brett this alternative spelling with varying numbers of ks began as a tongueincheek attempt to emphasize the musics hardness but by the mids it came to be associated with a controversial point of view that the music was and perhaps always had been wholly separate from detroits techno deriving instead from a s ebmoriented club scene cultivated in part by djmusician talla xlc in frankfurt
at some point tension over who defines techno arose between scenes in frankfurt and berlin dj tanith has expressed that techno as a term already existed in germany but was to a large extent undefined dimitri hegemann has stated that the frankfurt definition of techno associated with tallas technoclub differed from that used in berlin frankfurts armin johnert viewed techno as having its roots in acts such daf cabaret voltaire and suicide but a younger generation of club goers had a perception of the older ebm and industrial as handed down and outdated the berlin scene offered an alternative and many began embracing an imported sound that was being referred to as technohouse the move away from ebm had started in berlin when acid house became popular thanks to monika dietls radio show on sfb tanith distinguished acidbased dance music from the earlier approaches whether it be daf or nitzer ebb because the latter was aggressive he felt that it epitomized being against something but of acid house he said its electronic its fun its nice by spring tanith along with wolle xdp an eastberlin party organizer responsible for the xtasy dance project were organizing the first large scale rave events in germany this development would lead to a permanent move away from the sound associated with technohouse and toward a hard edged mix of music that came to define tanith and wolles tekknozid parties according to wolle it was an out and out rejection of disco values instead they created a sound storm and encouraged a form of dance floor socialism where the dj was not placed in the middle and you lose yourself in light and sound
developments
as the techno sound evolved in the late s and early s it also diverged to such an extent that a wide spectrum of stylistically distinct music was being referred to as techno this ranged from relatively pop oriented acts such as moby to the distinctly anticommercial sentiments of underground resistance derrick mays experimentation on works such as beyond the dance and the beginning were credited with taking techno in dozens of new directions at once and having the kind of expansive impact john coltrane had on jazz the birminghambased label network records label was instrumental in introducing detroit techno to british audiences by the early s the original techno sound had garnered a large underground following in the united kingdom germany the netherlands and belgium the growth of technos popularity in europe between and was largely due to the emergence of the rave scene and a thriving club culture
exodus
in america apart from regional scenes in detroit new york city chicago and orlando interest was limited producers from detroit frustrated by the lack of opportunity in their home country looked to europe for their future livelihood this first wave of detroit expatriates was soon joined by a number of upandcoming artists the socalled second wave including carl craig octave one jay denham kenny larkin and stacey pullen with urs jeff mills mike banks and robert hood pushing their own unique sound a number of new york producers were also making an impression at this time notably frankie bones lenny dee and joey beltram in the same period close to detroit windsor ontario richie hawtin with business partner john acquaviva launched the influential imprint plus records
developments in americanproduced techno between and fueled the expansion and eventual divergence of techno in europe particularly in germany in berlin following the closure of a free party venue called ufo the club tresor opened in the venue was for a time the standard bearer for techno and played host to many of the leading detroit producers some of whom relocated to berlin by as interest in techno in the uk club scene started to wane berlin was considered the unofficial techno capital of europe
although eclipsed by germany belgium was another focus of secondwave techno in this time period the ghentbased label rs records embraced harderedged techno by teenage prodigies like beltram and cj bolland releasing tough metallic trackswith harsh discordant synth lines that sounded like distressed hoovers according to one music journalist
in the united kingdom sub club opening in glasgow in and trade which opened its doors to londoners in were pioneering venues which helped bring techno into the country both clubs were praised for their late opening hours and partyfocused clientele trade has often been referred to as the original all night bender
a techno alliance
in the german techno label tresor records released the compilation album tresor ii berlin detroit a techno alliance a testament to the influence of the detroit sound upon the german techno scene and a celebration of a mutual admiration pact between the two cities as the mids approached berlin was becoming a haven for detroit producers jeff mills and blake baxter even resided there for a time in the same period with the assistance of tresor underground resistance released their xxx album series juan atkins collaborated with mbs thomas fehlmann and moritz von oswald and tresoraffiliated label basic channel had its releases mastered by detroits national sound corporation the main mastering house for the entire detroit dance music scene in a sense popular electronic music had come full circle returning to germany home of a primary influence on the edm of the s düsseldorfs kraftwerk the dance sounds of chicago and detroit also had another german connection as it was in munich that giorgio moroder and pete bellotte first produced the synthesizergenerated eurodisco sound including the seminal fouronthefloor track i feel love
minimal techno
main article minimal techno
as techno continued to transmute a number of detroit producers began to question the trajectory the music was taking one response came in the form of socalled minimal techno a term producer daniel bell found difficult to accept finding the term minimalism in the artistic sense of the word too arty it is thought that robert hood a detroitbased producer and one time member of ur is largely responsible for ushering in the minimal strain of techno hood describes the situation in the early s as one where techno had become too ravey with increasing tempos the emergence of gabber and related trends straying far from the social commentary and soulinfused sound of original detroit techno in response hood and others sought to emphasize a single element of the detroit aesthetic interpreting techno with a basic stripped down raw sound just drums basslines and funky grooves and only whats essential only what is essential to make people move hood explains
i think dan bell and i both realized that something was missing an elementin what we both know as techno it sounded great from a production point of standpoint but there was a jack element in the old structure people would complain that theres no funk no feeling in techno anymore and the easy escape is to put a vocalist and some piano on top to fill the emotional gap i thought it was time for a return to the original underground
jazz influences

some techno has also been influenced by or directly infused with elements of jazz this led to increased sophistication in the use of both rhythm and harmony in a number of techno productions manchester ukbased techno act state helped fuel this development with tracks such as pacific state and cobra bora in detroit producer mike banks was heavily influenced by jazz as demonstrated on the influential underground resistance release nation nation by detroit acts such as model and ur had made explicit references to the genre with the tracks jazz is the teacher and hitech jazz the latter being part of a larger body of work and group called galaxy galaxy a selfdescribed jazz project based on kraftwerks man machine doctrine this lead was followed by a number of techno producers in the uk who were influenced by both jazz and ur dave angels seas of tranquility ep being a case in point other notable artists who set about expanding upon the structure of classic techno include dan curtin morgan geist titonton duvante and ian obrien
intelligent techno

in uk music journalist matthew collin wrote that europe may have the scene and the energy but its america which supplies the ideological directionif belgian techno gives us riffs german techno the noise british techno the breakbeats then detroit supplies the sheer cerebral depth by a number of european producers and labels began to associate rave culture with the corruption and commercialization of the original techno ideal following this the notion of an intelligent or detroit inspired pure techno aesthetic began to take hold detroit techno had maintained its integrity throughout the rave era and was pushing a new generation of socalled intelligent techno producers forward simon reynolds suggests that this progression involved a fullscale retreat from the most radically posthuman and hedonistically functional aspects of rave music toward more traditional ideas about creativity namely the auteur theory of the solitary genius who humanizes technology
the term intelligent techno was used to differentiate more sophisticated versions of underground techno from raveoriented styles such as breakbeat hardcore schranz dutch gabber warp records was among the first to capitalize upon this development with the release of the compilation album artificial intelligence of this time warp founder and managing director steve beckett said
the dance scene was changing and we were hearing bsides that werent dance but were interesting and fitted into experimental progressive rock so we decided to make the compilation artificial intelligence which became a milestone it felt like we were leading the market rather than it leading us the music was aimed at home listening rather than clubs and dance floors people coming home off their nuts and having the most interesting part of the night listening to totally tripped out music the sound fed the scene
warp had originally marketed artificial intelligence using the description electronic listening music but this was quickly replaced by intelligent techno in the same period other names were also bandied about such as armchair techno ambient techno and electronica but all referred to an emerging form of postrave dance music for the sedentary and stay at home following the commercial success of the compilation in the united states intelligent dance music eventually became the name most commonly used for much of the experimental dance music emerging during the midtolate s
although it is primarily warp that has been credited with ushering the commercial growth of idm and electronica in the early s there were many notable labels associated with the initial intelligence trend that received little if any wider attention amongst others they include black dog productions carl craigs planet e kirk degiorgios applied rhythmic technology eevo lute muzique general production recordings in a number of new intelligent technoelectronica record labels emerged including new electronica mille plateaux pure and ferox records 
free techno

in the early s a postrave diy free party scene had established itself in the uk it was largely based around an alliance between warehouse party goers from various urban squat scenes and politically inspired new age travellers the new agers offered a readymade network of countryside festivals that were hastily adopted by squatters and ravers alike prominent among the sound systems operating at this time were exodus in luton tonka in brighton smokescreen in sheffield diy in nottingham bedlam circus warp lsdiesel and londons spiral tribe the high point of this free party period came in may when with less than hours notice and little publicity more than gathered at the castlemorton common festival for days of partying
this one event was largely responsible for the introduction in of the criminal justice and public order act effectively leaving the british free party scene for dead following this many of the traveller artists moved away from britain to europe the us goa in india koh phangan in thailand and australias east coast in the rest of europe due in some part to the inspiration of traveling sound systems from the uk rave enjoyed a prolonged existence as it continued to expand across the continent
spiral tribe bedlam and other english sound systems took their cooperative techno ideas to europe particularly eastern europe where it was cheaper to live and audiences were quick to appropriate the free party ideology it was european teknival free parties such as the annual czechtek event in the czech republic that gave rise to several french german and dutch sound systems many of these groups found audiences easily and were often centered around squats in cities such as amsterdam and berlin
divergence

by there were a number of techno producers in the uk and europe building on the detroit sound but a number of other underground dance music styles were by then vying for attention some drew upon the detroit techno aesthetic while others fused components of preceding dance music forms this led to the appearance in the uk initially of inventive new music that sounded farremoved from techno for instance jungle drum and bass demonstrated influences ranging from hip hop soul and reggae to techno and house
with an increasing diversification and commercialization of dance music the collectivist sentiment prominent in the early rave scene diminished each new faction having its own particular attitude and vision of how dance music or in certain cases nondance music should evolve according to muzik magazine by the uk techno scene was in decline and dedicated club nights were dwindling the music had become too hard too fast too male too drugoriented too anally retentive despite this weekly night at clubs such as final frontier londonthe orbit leeds house of god birmingham pure edinburgh whose resident dj twitch later founded the more eclectic optimo and bugged out manchester were still popular with techno reaching a state of creative palsy and with a disproportionate number of underground dance music enthusiasts more interested in the sounds of rave and jungle in the future of the uk techno scene looked uncertain as the market for pure techno waned muzik described the sound of uk techno at this time as dutiful grovelling at the altar of american techno with a total unwillingness to compromise
by the end of the s a number of posttechno underground styles had emerged including ghettotech a style that combines some of the aesthetics of techno with hiphop and house music nortec glitch digital hardcore electroclash and socalled nobeat techno
in attempting to sum up the changes since the heyday of detroit techno derrick may has since revised his famous quote in stating that kraftwerk got off on the third floor and now george clintons got napalm death in there with him the elevators stalled between the pharmacy and the athletic wear store
commercial exposure
while techno and its derivatives only occasionally produce commercially successful mainstream actsunderworld and orbital being two betterknown examplesthe genre has significantly affected many other areas of music in an effort to appear relevant many established artists for example madonna and u have dabbled with dance music yet such endeavors have rarely evidenced a genuine understanding or appreciation of technos origins with the former proclaiming in january that technodeath
the rb artist missy elliott exposed the popular music audience to the detroit techno sound when she featured material from cybotrons clear on her release lose control this resulted in juan atkins receiving a grammy award nomination for his writing credit elliotts album miss e so addictive also clearly demonstrated the influence of techno inspired club culture
in the late s the publication of relatively accurate histories by authors simon reynolds generation ecstasy also known as energy flash and dan sicko techno rebels plus mainstream press coverage of the detroit electronic music festival in the s helped diffuse some of the genres more dubious mythology even the detroitbased company ford motors eventually became savvy to the mass appeal of techno noting that this music was created partly by the pounding clangor of the motor citys auto factories it became natural for us to incorporate detroit techno into our commercials after we discovered that young people are embracing techno with a marketing campaign targeting unders ford used detroit techno as a print ad slogan and chose model s no ufos to underpin its november mtv television advertisement for the ford focus
antecedents
early use of the term techno
in steve fairnie and bev sage formed an electronica band called the techno twins in london england when kraftwerk first toured japan their music was described as technopop by the japanese press the japanese band yellow magic orchestra used the word techno in a number of their works such as the song technopolis the album technodelic and a rare flexi disc ep the spirit of techno when yellow magic orchestra toured the united states in they described their own music as technopop and were written up in rolling stone magazine around the members of ymo added synthesizer backing tracks to idol songs such as ikue sakakibaras robot and these songs were classified as techno kayou or bubblegum techno in billboard reviewed the canadian band skinny puppys album and described the genre as techno dance juan atkins himself said in fact there were a lot of electronic musicians around when cybotron started and i think maybe half of them referred to their music as techno however the public really wasnt ready for it until about or it just so happened that detroit was there when people really got into it
prototechno
the popularity of euro disco and italo discoreferred to as progressive in detroitand new romantic synthpop in the detroit high school party scene from which techno emerged has prompted a number of commentators to try to redefine the origins of techno by incorporating musical precursors to the detroit sound as part of a wider historical survey of the genres development the search for a mythical first techno record leads such commentators to consider music from long before the naming of the genre aside from the artists whose music was popular in the detroit high school scene progressive disco acts such as giorgio moroder alexander robotnick and claudio simonetti and synthpop artists such as visage new order depeche mode the human league and heaven they point to examples such as sharevari by a number of names danceable selections from kraftwerk the earliest compositions by cybotron moroders from here to eternity and manuel göttschings prototechno masterpiece ee the song i feel love produced by giorgio moroder for donna summer in has been described as a milestone and blueprint for edm because it was the first to combine repetitive synthesizer loops with a continuous fouronthefloor bass drum and an offbeat hihat which would become a main feature of techno and house ten years later another example is a record entitled love in c minor released in by parisian euro disco producer jeanmarc cerrone cited as the first so called conceptual disco production and the record from which house techno and other underground dance music styles flowed yet another example is yellow magic orchestras work which has been described as prototechno
around sheffield band cabaret voltaire began including funk and edm elements into their sound and in later years would come to be described as techno nitzer ebb was an essex band formed in which also showed funk and edm influence on their sound around this time the danish band laid back released white horse in with a similar funky electronica sound
prehistory
certain electrodisco and european synthpop productions share with techno a dependence on machinegenerated dance rhythms but such comparisons are not without contention efforts to regress further into the past in search of earlier antecedents entails a further regression to the sequenced electronic music of raymond scott whose the rhythm modulator the bassline generator and ibm probe are considered early examples of technolike music in a review of scotts manhattan research inc compilation album the english newspaper the independent suggested that scotts importance lies mainly in his realization of the rhythmic possibilities of electronic music which laid the foundation for all electropop from disco to techno in a tape from the midtolate s by the original composer of the doctor who theme delia derbyshire was found to contain music that sounded remarkably like contemporary edm commenting on the tape paul hartnoll of the dance group orbital described the example as quite amazing noting that it sounded not unlike something that could be coming out next week on warp records
music production practice
stylistic considerations
in general techno is very djfriendly being mainly instrumental commercial varieties being an exception and is produced with the intention of its being heard in the context of a continuous dj set wherein the dj progresses from one record to the next via a synchronized segue or mix much of the instrumentation in techno emphasizes the role of rhythm over other musical parameters but the design of synthetic timbres and the creative use of music production technology in general are important aspects of the overall aesthetic practice
unlike other forms of edm that tend to be produced with synthesizer keyboards techno does not always strictly adhere to the harmonic practice of western music and such strictures are often ignored in favor of timbral manipulation alone the use of motivic development though relatively limited and the employment of conventional musical frameworks is more widely found in commercial techno styles for example eurotrance where the template is often an aaba song structure
the main drum part is almost universally in common time meaning quarter note pulses per bar in its simplest form time is marked with kicks bass drum beats on each quarternote pulse a snare or clap on the second and fourth pulse of the bar with an open hihat sound every second eighth note this is essentially a drum pattern popularized by disco or even polka and is common throughout house and trance music as well the tempo tends to vary between approximately bpm quarter note equals pulses per minute and bpm depending on the style of techno
some of the drum programming employed in the original detroitbased techno made use of syncopation and polyrhythm yet in many cases the basic discotype pattern was used as a foundation with polyrhythmic elaborations added using other drum machine voices this syncopatedfeel funkiness distinguishes the detroit strain of techno from other variants it is a feature that many djs and producers still use to differentiate their music from commercial forms of techno the majority of which tend to be devoid of syncopation derrick may has summed up the sound as hitech tribalism something very spiritual very bass oriented and very drum oriented very percussive the original techno music was very hitech with a very percussive feel it was extremely extremely tribal it feels like youre in some sort of hitech village
compositional techniques
there are many ways to create techno but the majority will depend upon the use of loopbased step sequencing as a compositional method techno musicians or producers rather than employing traditional compositional techniques may work in an improvisatory fashion often treating the electronic music studio as one large instrument the collection of devices found in a typical studio will include units that are capable of producing many different sounds and effects studio production equipment is generally synchronized using a hardware or computerbased midi sequencer enabling the producer to combine in one arrangement the sequenced output of many devices a typical approach to using this type of technology compositionally is to overdub successive layers of material while continuously looping a single measure or sequence of measures this process will usually continue until a suitable multitrack arrangement has been produced
once a single loopbased arrangement has been generated a producer may then focus on developing how the summing of the overdubbed parts will unfold in time and what the final structure of the piece will be some producers achieve this by adding or removing layers of material at appropriate points in the mix quite often this is achieved by physically manipulating a mixer sequencer effects dynamic processing equalization and filtering while recording to a multitrack device other producers achieve similar results by using the automation features of computerbased digital audio workstations techno can consist of little more than cleverly programmed rhythmic sequences and looped motifs combined with signal processing of one variety or another frequency filtering being a commonly used process a more idiosyncratic approach to production is evident in the music of artists such as twerk and autechre where aspects of algorithmic composition are employed in the generation of material
retro technology
instruments used by the original techno producers based in detroit many of which are highly sought after on the retro music technology market include classic drum machines like the roland tr and tr devices such as the roland tb bass line generator and synthesizers such as the roland sh kawai kc yamaha dx and yamaha dx as heard on derrick mays seminal techno release nude photo much of the early music sequencing was executed via midi but neither the tr nor the tb had midi only din sync using hardware sequencers such as the korg sqd and roland mc and the limited amount of sampling that was featured in this early style was accomplished using an akai s
by the mids tr and tr drum machines had already achieved legendary status a fact reflected in the prices sought for used devices during the s the became the staple beat machine in hip hop production while the found its home in house music and techno it was the pioneers of detroit techno who were making the the rhythmic basis of their sound and setting the stage for the rise of rolands vintage rhythm composer in november the uk music technology magazine sound on sound noted
there can be few hitech instruments which still command a secondhand price only slightly lower than their original selling price years after their launch rolands now nearlegendary tr is such an examplereleased in with a retail price of £ they now fetch up to £ on the secondhand market the irony of the situation is that barely a year after its launch the was being chopped out by hitech dealers for around £ to make way for the thennew tr and tr prices hit a new low around when you could often pick up a seconduser for under £and occasionally even under £ musicians all over the country are now garrotting themselves with midi leads as they remember that they sneered at for £or worse the one they sold for £ did you ever hear the one about the guy who gave away his tb basslinenow worth anything up to £ from true loony collectorsbecause he couldnt sell it
by may sound on sound was reporting that the popularity of the had started to decline with the rarer tr taking its place as the dance floor drum machine to use this is thought to have arisen for a number of reasons the gives more control over the drum sounds has better programming and includes midi as standard sound on sound reported that the was selling for between £ and £ and noted that the was still collectible but maximum prices had peaked at about £ to £ despite this fascination with retro music technology according to derrick may there is no recipe there is no keyboard or drum machine which makes the best techno or whatever you want to call it there never has been it was down to the preferences of a few guys the was our preference we were using yamaha drum machines different percussion machines whatever
emulation
in the latter half of the s the demand for vintage drum machines and synthesizers motivated a number of software companies to produce computerbased emulators one of the most notable was the rebirth rb produced by the swedish company propellerhead and originally released in may version one of the software featured two tbs and a tr only but the release of version two saw the inclusion of a tr a sound on sound review of the rb v in november noted that rebirth had been called the ultimate techno software package and mentions that it was a considerable software success story of in america keyboard magazine asserted that rebirth had opened up a whole new paradigm modeled analog synthesizer tones percussion synthesis patternbased sequencing all integrated in one piece of software despite the success of rebirth rb it was officially taken out of production in september propellerhead then made it freely available for download from a website called the rebirth museum the site also features extensive information about the softwares history and development
in propellerhead released reason v a softwarebased electronic music studio comprising a input automated digital mixer note polyphonic analogue synth classic rolandstyle drum machine sampleplayback unit analoguestyle step sequencer loop player multitrack sequencer eight effects processors and over mb of synthesizer patches and samples with this release propellerhead were credited with creating a buzz that only happens when a product has really tapped into the zeitgeist and may just be the one that many were waiting for reason is as of at version 
technological advances
during the mid to late s as computer technology became more accessible and music software advanced interacting with music production technology was possible using means that bore little relationship to traditional musical performance practices for instance laptop performance laptronica and live coding by the mids a number of softwarebased virtual studio environments had emerged with products such as propellerheads reason and ableton live finding popular appeal also during this period software versions of classic devices that once existed exclusively in the hardware domain became available for the first time these softwarebased music production tools offered viable and costeffective alternatives to typical hardwarebased production studios and thanks to continued advances in microprocessor technology it became possible to create high quality music using little more than a single laptop computer using highly configurable software tools artists could also easily tailor their production sound by creating personalized software synthesizers effects modules and various composition environments some of the more popular programs for achieving such ends included commercial releases such as maxmsp and reaktor and freeware packages such as pure data supercollider and chuck in a certain sense this technological innovation lead to the resurgence of the diy mentality that was once central to dance music culture in the s these advances democratized music creation and lead to a significant increase in the amount of homeproduced music available to the general public via the internet
notable techno venues
in germany noted techno clubs of the s include tresor and ewerk in berlin omen and dorian gray in frankfurt ultraschall and in munich as well as stammheim in kassel in berghain was cited as possibly the current world capital of techno much as ewerk or tresor were in their respective heydays in the s aside from berlin germany continued to have a thriving techno scene with clubs such as gewölbe in cologne institut für zukunft in leipzig mma club and blitz club in munich die rakete in nuremberg and robert johnson in offenbach am main
in the united kingdom glasgows sub club has been associated with techno since the early s and clubs such as londons fabric and egg london have gained notoriety for supporting techno in the s a techno scene also emerged in georgia with the bassiani in tbilisi being the most notable venue""";
